## Background

- Reverse proxy is one of most popular features of Easegress and it's suitable
  for many production and development scenarios.

- In reversed proxy use cases, `WebSocket` is a widely used protocol for a
  full-duplex communication solution between client and server. WebSocket
  relies on TCP.[1]

- Many reverse proxy support `WebSocket`,e.g., NGINX[2], Traefik, and so on.

## Design

- The `WebSocketProxy` is a filter of Easegress, and can be put into a pipeline.
- Easegress uses `github.com/golang/x/net/websocket` to implement
  `WebSocketProxy` filter.

1. Spec

* Pipeline with a `WebSocketProxy` filter:
 
```yaml
name: websocket-pipeline
kind: Pipeline

flow:
- filter: wsproxy

filters:
- kind: WebSocketProxy
  name: wsproxy
  defaultOrigin: http://127.0.0.1/hello
  pools:
  - servers:
    - url: ws://127.0.0.1:12345
 ```

* HTTPServer to route traffic to the websocket-pipeline:
 
```yaml
name: demo-server
kind: HTTPServer
port: 8080
rules:
- paths:
  - path: /ws
    clientMaxBodySize: -1          # REQUIRED!
    backend: websocket-pipeline
```

Note: `clientMaxBodySize` must be `-1`.

2. Request sequence

    ```none
    +--------------+                +--------------+                +--------------+  
    |              |  1             |              |   2            |              | 
    |   client     +--------------->|  Easegress   +--------------->|  websocket   |
    |              |<---------------+              |<---------------+  backend     | 
    |              |  4             |              |   3            |              |
    +--------------+                +--------------+                +--------------+
    ```

3. Headers

We copy all headers from your HTTP request to websocket backend, except
ones used by websocket package to build connection. Based on [3], we also
add `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto` to http
headers that send to websocket backend.

> note: websocket use `Upgrade`, `Connection`, `Sec-Websocket-Key`,
  `Sec-Websocket-Version`, `Sec-Websocket-Extensions` and
  `Sec-Websocket-Protocol` in http headers to set connection.

## Health Check

### Health Check
Perform a health check on the servers in the pool. If a server fails the check, it will be marked as unhealthy, and requests will be rerouted to other healthy servers until it regains health. Health check for websocket proxy contains both http way or websocket way. The HTTP check involves a request-response evaluation similar to a Proxy filter. In the WebSocket method, a successful connection yields a 101 status code. Additional headers can be set and evaluated in both methods. 
If you send both two ways of health check, then a server passes both HTTP and WebSocket health checks, it will be considered healthy.

More details in [WebSocketProxy](../07.Reference/7.02.Filters.md#health-check-1).

```yaml
kind: WebSocketProxy
name: proxy-example-1
pools:
- servers:
  - url: ws://127.0.0.1:9095
  - url: ws://127.0.0.1:9096
  - url: ws://127.0.0.1:9097
  healthCheck:
    # interval between health checks (default: 60s)
    interval: 60s
    # timeout for health check response (default: 3s)
    timeout: 3s
    # fail threshold to mark server as unhealthy (default: 1)
    fails: 1
    # success threshold to mark server as healthy (default: 1)
    pass: 1

    ws:
      # health check request port (defaults to server's port, e.g., 9095)
      port: 10080
      # uri for health check
      uri: /health/ws
      # http request headers for health check
      headers:
        X-Health-Check: easegress

      # response validation criteria (default: 101 Switching Protocols)
      match:
        # acceptable status code ranges 
        statusCodes:
        - [101, 101] # 101
        # response header validation
        # name is header key.
        # value is header value, can be empty. 
        # type is type of value, can be "exact" or "regexp".
        headers:
        - name: X-Status
          value: healthy
          type: exact
    http:
      uri: /health
```

## Example

1. Send request

    ```bash
    curl --include \
        --no-buffer \
        --header "Connection: Upgrade" \
        --header "Upgrade: websocket" \
        --header "Host: 127.0.0.1:10020" \
        --header "Sec-WebSocket-Key: your-key-here" \
        --header "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" \
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    ```

2. This request to Easegress will be forwarded to websocket backend
   `ws://127.0.0.1:12345`.
