## Introduction

The AI Gateway enables seamless proxying of large language model (LLM) APIs following OpenAI specifications. We support providers such as OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic and so on. See [Supported Providers](../07.Reference/7.01.Controllers.md#supported-providers) for the complete list.

Beyond the basic proxying capabilities, the AI Gateway offers advanced features such as response caching, and dynamic routing based on real-time statistics. These enhancements ensure optimal performance and flexibility when integrating with various AI services.

## Configuring AI Gateway

To set up the AI Gateway, we need to create an `AIGatewayController` resource. This resource will manage the configuration and lifecycle of the AI Gateway, including the supported LLM providers and any specific routing or caching rules.

We have subcommand `egctl ai` to manage the AI Gateway configuration easily.

```bash
$ egctl ai enable

# It is the short form of:
$ echo 'kind: AIGatewayController
name: AIGatewayController' | egctl create -f -
```

To disable the AI Gateway, we can use the following command:

```bash
$ egctl ai disable

# It is the short form of:
$ egctl delete AIGatewayController AIGatewayController
```

> NOTICE: The deletion of the AI Gateway will remove all associated configurations(like api keys). Please proceed with caution.

```bash
# To view the current configuration of the AI Gateway, we can use:
$ egctl get AIGatewayController AIGatewayController -o yaml

$ egctl ai edit # Edit the AIGatewayController resource in the default editor.

# It is the short form of:
$ egctl edit aigatewaycontroller AIGatewayController
```

Basic configuration of the AI Gateway can be done through the `AIGatewayController` resource. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
kind: AIGatewayController
name: AIGatewayController
providers:
    - name: openai-provider
      providerType: openai
      baseURL: https://api.openai.com
      apiKey: sk-proj-openai-api-key # Replace with your OpenAI API key
    - name: deepseek-provider
      providerType: deepseek
      baseURL: https://api.deepseek.com
      apiKey: sk-deepseek-api-key # Replace with your DeepSeek API key
version: easegress.megaease.com/v2
```

Besides using `egctl ai edit` to modify the configuration, we can still save it as `aigateway.yaml` and apply it:

```bash
egctl apply -f aigateway.yaml
```

After adding one or more providers, we can add Filter AIGatewayProxy in `Pipeline` to proxy requests to the providers. Here is an example of a `Pipeline` configuration that uses the AI Gateway:

```bash
echo 'name: ai-gateway-pipeline
kind: Pipeline
filters:
  - name: ai-gateway-proxy
    kind: AIGatewayProxy
    providerName: deepseek-provider # one of the provider names in the controller to use
' | egctl create -f -

echo 'kind: HTTPServer
name: ai-gateway-server
port: 8080
rules:
  - paths:
    - pathPrefix: /
      backend: ai-gateway-pipeline' | egctl create -f -

# Now we can access the AI Gateway through the HTTP server
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-chat",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'

```

## Observability

We can check the status of the AI Gateway providers using the following command:

```bash
$ egctl ai check
NAME       PROVIDER-TYPE HEALTHY
openai-provider  openai      YES
deepseek-provider deepseek     YES
```

We can also view the statistics of the AI Gateway, including the number of requests, success/failure rates, and average response times for each provider:

```bash
$ egctl ai stat
PROVIDER(TYPE) MODEL@BASEURL RESP-TYPE TOTAL-REQ SUCCESS/FAILED AVG-DUR(ms) TOKENS(INPUT/OUTPUT)
openai-provider(openai)  gpt-4o@https://api.openai.com  /v1/chat/completions 2  2/0  1842  26/72
deepseek-provider(deepseek) deepseek-chat@https://api.deepseek.com /v1/chat/completions 2  2/0  107  18/177
```
