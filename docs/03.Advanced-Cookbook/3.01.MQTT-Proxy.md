## Background
- MQTT is a standard messaging protocol for IoT (Internet of Things) which is extremely lightweight and used by a wide variety of industries.
- By supporting MQTT Proxy in Easegress, MQTT clients can produce messages to backend through publish packet pipeline.
- We also provide the HTTP endpoint to allow the backend to send messages to MQTT clients.

## Design
- Use `github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang/packets` to parse MQTT packet. `paho.mqtt.golang` is a MQTT 3.1.1 go client introduced by Eclipse Foundation (who also introduced the most widely used MQTT broker mosquitto).
- As a MQTT proxy, we support MQTT clients to `publish` messages to backend through publish packet pipeline.
- As `Pipeline` is protocol independent, it can use MQTT filters to do things like user authentication or topic mapping (map MQTT multi-level topic into single topic and key-value headers).
- We also support MQTT clients to `subscribe` topics (wildcard is supported) and send messages back to the MQTT clients through the HTTP endpoint.

By default:
```
             publish msg                       publish pipeline
MQTT client ------------> Easegress MQTTProxy ----------------> Backend like Kafka

all published msg will go to Backend, will not send to other MQTT clients.

             subscribe msg
MQTT client <---------------- Easegress MQTT HTTP Endpoint <---- Backend Server

all msg send back to MQTT clients come from HTTP endpoint.
```
- We assume that IoT devices (use MQTT client) report their status to the backend (through tools like Kafka), and backend process these messages and send instructions back to IoT devices.

Using `brokerMode`:
```
             publish msg                       publish pipeline
MQTT client ------------> Easegress MQTTProxy ----------------> Backend like Kafka
                              |
                              | also send msg to subscribers
                              |
             subscribe msg            send msg through http endpoint
MQTT client <------------ Easegress <------------------------------- Backend Server
```
By setting `brokerMode` to `true`. MQTTProxy can both send msg to backend and subscribers. Users can also send msg to clients by using HTTP endpoint.

## Example
Save following yaml to file `mqttproxy.yaml` and then run
```bash
egctl create -f mqttproxy.yaml
```
```yaml
kind: MQTTProxy
name: mqttproxy
port: 1883  # tcp port for mqtt clients to connect
useTLS: true
certificate:
- name: cert1
  cert: balabala
  key: keyForbalabala
- name: cert2
  cert: foo
  key: bar
rules:
- when:
    packetType: Connect
  pipeline: pipeline-mqtt-auth
- when:
    packetType: Publish
  pipeline: pipeline-mqtt-publish
# by default, brokerMode is disabled. 
brokerMode: true

---

name: pipeline-mqtt-auth
kind: Pipeline
protocol: MQTT
flow:
- filter: auth
filters:
- name: auth
  kind: MQTTClientAuth
  salt: salt
  auth:
  # username and password are both test
  - username: test
    saltedSha256Pass: 1bc1a361f17092bc7af4b2f82bf9194ea9ee2ca49eb2e53e39f555bc1eeaed74

---

name: pipeline-mqtt-publish
kind: Pipeline
protocol: MQTT
flow:
- filter: publish-kafka-backend
filters:
- name: publish-kafka-backend
  kind: KafkaMQTT
  backend: ["127.0.0.1:9092"]
  topic:
    default: kafka-topic
```
In this example, we use pipeline to process MQTT Connect packet (check username and password) and Publish packet (send to Kafka backend).

Now, we support following filters for MQTTProxy:
- `TopicMapper`: map MQTT Publish packet multi-level topic into single topic and key-value headers.
- `MQTTClientAuth`: provide username and password checking for MQTT Connect packet.
- `KafkaMQTT`: send MQTT Publish message to Kafka backend. By default, `KafkaMQTT` filter will add `clientID`, `username`, `mqttTopic` to Kafka message headers.

## Topic Mapping
In MQTT, there are multi-levels in a topic. Topic mapping is used to map MQTT topic to a single topic with headers. For example:
```
MQTT multi-level topics:
- beijing/car/123/log
- shanghai/tv/234/status
- nanjing/phone/456/error

with corresponding pattern:
- loc/device/ID/event

with Topic mapper, may produce Kafka topic:
- topic: iot_device, headers: {loc: beijing, device: car, ID: 123, event: log}
- topic: iot_device, headers: {loc: shanghai, device: tv, ID: 234, event: status}
- topic: iot_device, headers: {loc: nanjing, device: phone, ID: 456, event: error}
```

Topic mapping can make processing MQTT messages easier. In Easegress, we use filter `TopicMapper` to do topic mapping.

Here's a simple example:
```yaml
name: pipeline-mqtt-publish
kind: Pipeline
protocol: MQTT
flow:
- filter: topic-mapper
- filter: publish-kafka-backend
filters:
- name: topic-mapper
  kind: TopicMapper
  setKV:  # setKV set topic and header map into MQTT Context
    topic: kafka-topic
    headers: kafka-headers
  # matchIndex and route will decide which policy we use to do the mapping for MQTT topic
  matchIndex: 0
  route:
  - name: gateway
      matchExpr: "gate*"
  - name: direct
      matchExpr: "dir*"
  # policies define how to create topic and header map by using MQTT publish topic.
  policies:
    - name: direct
      topicIndex: 1
      route:
      - topic: iot_phone
        exprs: ["iphone", "xiaomi", "oppo", "pixel"]
      - topic: iot_other
        exprs: [".*"]
      headers:
      0: direct
      1: device
      2: status
    - name: gateway
      topicIndex: 3
      route:
      - topic: iot_phone
        exprs: ["iphone", "xiaomi", "oppo", "pixel"]
      - topic: iot_other
        exprs: [".*"]
      headers:
      0: gateway
      1: gatewayID
      2: device
      3: status
- name: publish-kafka-backend
  kind: KafkaMQTT
  backend: ["my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.kafka:9092"]
  topic:
    default: kafka-topic
  mqtt:
    # since we don't use original topic name in MQTT Publish packet.
    # we need keys to get topic and header map from MQTT Context.
    topicKey: kafka-topic
    headerKey: kafka-headers
```

### Match different topic mapping policy
Consider there may be multiple schemas for your MQTT topic, so we first provide a router to route your MQTT topic to different mapping policies and then do the map in that policy.

For example,
```
schema1: gateway/gatewayID/device/status
schema2: direct/device/status

...
    # matchIndex is the MQTT topic level used to match the route policy
    matchIndex: 0
    route:
    - name: gateway
        matchExpr: "gate*"
    - name: direct
        matchExpr: "dir*"
...
```
means that we use MQTT topic level 0 to match `matchExpr` to find a corresponding policy. In this case, `gateway/gate123/iphone/log` will match policy `gateway`, `direct/iphone/log` will match policy `direct`.


### Detail of single policy
```
  policies:
    - name: direct
      topicIndex: 1
      route:
      - topic: iot_phone
        exprs: ["iphone", "xiaomi", "oppo", "pixel"]
      - topic: iot_other
        exprs: [".*"]
      headers:
      0: direct
      1: device
      2: status
```
`topicIndex` is the MQTT topic level used to produce Kafka topic (Regular expressions supported), in this case, `direct/iphone/...` will produce Kafka topic `iot_phone`, but `direct/car/...` will produce Kafka topic `iot_other`. `headers` used to produce Kafka headers.

More example about topic mapper:
```
use yaml above:
MQTT topic:
pattern1: gateway/gatewayID/device/status -> match policy gateway
pattern2: direct/device/status -> match policy direct

example1: "gateway/gate123/iphone/log"
topic and header map:
    topic: iot_phone
    headers:
        gateway: gateway
        gatewayID: gate123
        device: iphone
        status: log

example2: "direct/xiaomi/status"
topic and header map:
    topic: iot_phone
    headers:
        direct: direct
        device: xiaomi
        status: status

example3: "direct/tv/log"
topic and header map:
    topic: iot_other
    headers:
        direct: direct
        device: tv
        status: log
```
Empty `topicMapper` means there is no map between the MQTT topic and Kafka topic.

> Note: For MQTT topic `"gateway/gate123/iphone/log"`, index 0 is `"gateway"`. For `"/gateway/gate123/iphone/log"` index 0 is still `"gateway"` not `""`. So, index 0 is the first non-empty level of multi-level MQTT topic.

## HTTP endpoint
We support the backend to send messages back to MQTT clients through the HTTP endpoint.

API for http endpoint:
- Host: Easegress IP, for example `http://127.0.0.1`
- Port: Easegress API address, by default, `:2381`
- Path: `apis/v1/mqttproxy/{name}/topics/publish`, where name is the name of MQTT proxy
- Method: POST
- Body:
```json
{
  "topic": "yourTopicName",
  "qos": 1,
  "payload": "dataPayload",
  "base64": false
}
```
> Note:   Currently, the QoS only support `0` and `1`

To send binary data, you can encode your binary data base64 and send `base64` flag to `true`. Your client will receive the original binary data, we will do the decode.
- Status code:
  - 200: Success
  - 400: StatusBadRequest, may wrong http method, or wrong data (qos send to illegal number) etc.

The HTTP endpoint schema also works for multi-node deployment. Say you have 3 Easegress instances called `eg-0`, `eg-1`, `eg-2`, and your MQTT client connects to `eg-0`, if you send messages to `eg-1`, your client will receive the message too.

We also support wildcard subscriptions.
For example,
```
POST http://127.0.0.1:2381/apis/v2/mqttproxy/mqttproxy/topics/publish
{
  "topic": "Beijing/Phone/Update",
  "qos": 1, // currently only support 0 and 1
  "payload": "time to update",
  "base64": false
}

the clients subscribe following topics will receive the message:
"Beijing/Phone/Update"
"Beijing/+/Update"
"Beijing/Phone/+"
"+/Phone/Update"
"Beijing/+/+"
"Beijing/#"
"+/+/+"
```
