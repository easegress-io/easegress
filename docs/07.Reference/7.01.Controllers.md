As the [architecture diagram](../imgs/architecture.png) shows, the controller is the core entity to control kinds of working. There are two kinds of controllers overall:

- System Controller: It is created one and only one instance in every Easegress node, which can't be deleted. They mainly aim to control essential system-level stuff.
- Business Controller: It could be created, updated, deleted by admin operation. They control various resources such as mesh traffic, service discovery, faas, and so on.

In another view, Easegress as a traffic orchestration system, we could classify them into traffic controller and non-traffic controller:

- Traffic Controller: It invokes TrafficController to handle its specific traffic, such as MeshController.
- Non-Traffic Controller: It doesn't handle business traffic, such as EurekaServiceRegistry, even though it has admin traffic with Eureka.

The two categories are conceptual, which means they are not strict distinctions. We just use them as terms to clarify controllers technically.

## System Controllers

For now, all system controllers can not be configured. It may gain this capability if necessary in the future.

### ServiceRegistry

We use the system controller `ServiceRegistry` as the service hub for all service registries. Current drivers are

- [ConsulServiceRegistry](#consulserviceregistry)
- [EtcdServiceRegistry](#etcdserviceregistry)
- [EurekaServiceRegistry](#eurekaserviceregistry)
- [ZookeeperServiceRegistry](#zookeeperserviceregistry)
- [NacosServiceRegistry](#nacosserviceregistry)

The drivers need to offer notifying change periodically, and operations to the external service registry.

### TrafficController

TrafficController handles the lifecycle of Traffic Gates (like HTTPServer) and Pipeline and their relationship. It manages the resource in a namespaced way. Traffic gates accepts incoming traffic and routes it to Pipelines in the same namespace. Most other controllers could handle traffic by leverage the ability of TrafficController..

### RawConfigTrafficController

RawConfigTrafficController maps all traffic static configurations to TrafficController in the namespace `default`. We could use `egctl` to manage the configuration of servers and pipelines in the default namespace.

#### HTTPServer

HTTPServer is a server that listens on one port to route all traffic to available pipelines. Its simplest config looks like:

```yaml
kind: HTTPServer
name: http-server-example
port: 80
rules:
  - paths:
    - pathPrefix: /pipeline
      backend: http-pipeline-example
```

#### GRPCServer

The `GRPCServer` in Easegress provides robust functionality tailored to gRPC protocol interactions. With its IP filtering feature, traffic can be selectively allowed or blocked, ensuring that only desired clients can communicate with the services. Additionally, the server's routing rules offer flexible methods to determine how each incoming request is processed and forwarded, based on host, method, headers, and other criteria.

``` yaml
name: server-grpc
kind: GRPCServer
port: 8080

# The maximum number of connections allowed by gRPC Server.
# Default value 10240
maxConnections: 10240

# IP Filter for all traffic under the server
ipFilter:
  blockIPs: []
  allowIPs: []
  blockByDefault: false

# routing rules
rules:
# Rules for host matching.
# If not match, GRPCServer will check next rule.
- host: <your-host>
  hostRegexp: <your-host-regexp>

  methods: 
  - method: /Sale/AddProduct # Exact method match
    backend: sale-pipeline

  - methodPrefix: /IT        # Matches method with the given prefix
    backend: it-pipeline

  - headers:                 # Matches by header
    - key: x-geo-country
      values: ["CN", "EU", "US"]
    - key: user-agent
      values: ["SaleClient/1.0.0"]
    matchAllHeader: false
    backend: header-pipeline

  - methodRegexp: .*         # Match by regexp
    backend: other-pipeline

# more rules
- methods:
  ...
```

##### Example Requests  <!-- omit from toc -->
- A gRPC request with method `/Sale/AddProduct` will be routed to the `sale-pipeline`.
- Any request with a method starting with `/IT` (e.g., `/IT/UpdateSoftware`) will be directed to the `it-pipeline`.
- If a client sends a request with headers `x-geo-country` set to `CN` and `user-agent` set to `SaleClient/1.0.0`, it will be handled by the `header-pipeline`.
- All other requests (due to the wildcard `methodRegexp`) will be sent to the `other-pipeline`.

##### Configuration <!-- omit from toc -->
The below parameters will help manage connections better

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| maxConnections | uint32 | The maximum number of connections allowed by gRPC Server , default value 10240, min is 1 | No |
| minTimeClientSendPing | duration | The minimum amount of time a client should wait before sending a keepalive ping, default value is 5 minutes | No |
| permitClintSendPingWithoutStream | duration | If true, server allows keepalive pings even when there are no active streams(RPCs). If false, and client sends ping when there are no active streams, server will send GOAWAY and close the connection. default false | No |
| maxConnectionIdle | duration | A duration for the amount of time after which an idle connection would be closed by sending a GoAway. Idleness duration is defined since the most recent time the number of outstanding RPCs became zero or the connection establishment. default value is infinity | No |
| maxConnectionAge | duration | A duration for the maximum amount of time a connection may exist before it will be closed by sending a GoAway. A random jitter of ±10% will be added to MaxConnectionAge to prevent connection storms. default value is infinity | No |
| maxConnectionAgeGrace | duration | An additive period after MaxConnectionAge after which the connection will be forcibly closed. default value is infinity | No |
| keepaliveTime | duration | After a duration of this time if the server doesn't see any activity it pings the client to see if the transport is still alive. If set below 1s, a minimum value of 1s will be used instead. default value is 2 hours. | No |
| keepaliveTimeout | duration | After having pinged for keepalive check, the server waits for a duration of Timeout and if no activity is seen even after that the connection is closed. default value is 20 seconds |No |
| ipFilter | [ipfilter.Spec](#ipfilterSpec) | IP Filter for all traffic | No |
| rules | [][grpcserver.Rule](#grpcserverrule) | Router rules | No |


#### Pipeline

Pipeline is used to orchestrate filters. Its simplest config looks like:

```yaml
name: http-pipeline-example1
kind: Pipeline
flow:
- filter: proxy

filters:
- name: proxy
  kind: Proxy
  pools:
  - servers:
    - url: http://127.0.0.1:9095
```

The `flow` defines the execution order of filters. You can use `jumpIf` to
change the order.

For example, if a request’s header doesn’t have the key `X-Id` or its value
is not `user1` or `user2`, then the `validator` filter returns result `invalid`
and the pipeline jumps to `END`.

```yaml
name: http-pipeline-example2
kind: Pipeline
flow:
- filter: validator
  jumpIf:
    # END is a built-in filter, it stops the execution of the pipeline.
    invalid: END
- filter: proxy

filters:
- name: validator
  kind: Validator
  headers:
    X-Id:
      values: ["user1", "user2"]
- name: proxy
  kind: Proxy
  pools:
  - servers:
    - url: http://127.0.0.1:9095
```

> `jumpIf` can only jump to filters behind the current filter.

The `resilience` field defines resilience policies, if a filter implements the `filters.Resiliencer` interface (for now, only the `Proxy` filter implements the interface), the pipeline injects the policies into the filter instance after creating it.
A filter can implement the `filters.Resiliencer` interface to support resilience. There are two kinds of resilience, `Retry` and `CircuitBreaker`. Check [resilience](../02.Tutorials/2.4.Resilience.md) for more details. The following config adds a retry policy to the proxy filter:

```yaml
name: http-pipeline-example3
kind: Pipeline
flow:
- filter: proxy

filters:
- name: proxy
  kind: Proxy
  pools:
  - servers:
    - url: http://127.0.0.1:9095
    retryPolicy: retry

resilience:
- name: retry
  kind: Retry
  maxAttempts: 3
```

In this case, if `proxy` returns non-empty results, then resilience retry reruns the `proxy` filter until `proxy` returns empty results or gets the max attempts.

The `flow` also supports `namespace`, so the pipeline can support workflows that contain multiple requests and responses.

```yaml
name: http-pipeline-example4
kind: Pipeline
flow:
- filter: validator
  jumpIf:
    invalid: END
- filter: requestBuilderFoo
  namespace: foo
- filter: proxyFoo
  namespace: foo
- filter: requestBuilderBar
  namespace: bar
- filter: proxyBar
  namespace: bar
- filter: responseBuilder

filters:
- name: requestBuilder
  kind: RequestBuilder
  ...
...
```

In this case, `requestBuilderFoo` creates a request in namespace `foo`, and `proxyFoo` sends `foo` request and puts the response into namespace `foo`. `requestBuilderBar` creates a request in namespace `bar` and `proxyBar` sends `bar` request and puts the response into namespace `bar`. Finally, `requestBuilder` creates a response and puts it into the default namespace.

> If not set, the filter works in the default namespace `DEFAULT`.

The `alias` in `flow` gives a filter an alias to help re-use the filter so that we can use the alias to distinguish each of its appearances in the flow.

```yaml
name: http-pipeline-example5
kind: Pipeline
flow:
- filter: validator
  jumpIf:
    invalid: proxy2
- filter: proxy
# when meeting filter END, the pipeline execution stops and returns.
- filter: END
- filter: proxy
  alias: proxy2
- filter: responseAdaptor

filters:
- name: proxy
  kind: Proxy
  ...
```

In this case, we give second `proxy` alias `proxy2`, so request is invalid, it jumps to second proxy.

The `data` field defines static user data for the pipeline, which can be
accessed by filters. For example, in the below pipeline, the body of the result
request of the RequestBuilder will be `hello world`, which is the value of
data item `foo`.

```yaml
name: http-pipeline-example6
kind: Pipeline
flow:
  ...

filters:
- name: requestBuilder
  kind: RequestBuilder
  template: |
    body: {{.data.PIPELINE.foo}}

data:
  foo: "hello world"
```

| Name          | Type     | Description    | Required             |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| flow       | [][FlowNode](#pipelineflownode)  | The execution order of filters, if empty, will use the order of the filter definitions. | No  |
| filters    | []map[string]interface{}         | Defines filters, please refer [Filters](7.02.Filters.md) for details of a specific filter kind.     | Yes |
| resilience | []map[string]interface{}         | Defines resilience policies, please refer [Resilience Policy](#resiliencepolicy) for details of a specific resilience policy.    | No |
| data       | map[string]interface{}           | Static user data of the pipeline.         | No  |


### StatusSyncController

No config.

## Business Controllers

### GlobalFilter

`GlobalFilter` is a special pipeline that can be executed before or/and after all pipelines in a server. For example:

```yaml
name: globalFilter-example
kind: GlobalFilter
beforePipeline:
  flow:
  - filter: validator

  filters:
  - name: validator
    kind: Validator
    ...

# fallthrough controls the error handling behavior in different pipelines.
# specifying whether subsequent stages should execute despite encountering errors in earlier stages. 
# By default, encountering an error in either the beforePipeline or the pipeline stages halts the entire process.
fallthrough:
  # false indicates that if an error occurs in the beforePipeline, the pipeline will not execute.
  beforePipeline: false
  # false means that if an error occurs in the pipeline, the afterPipeline will not execute.
  pipeline: false
---
name: server-example
kind: HTTPServer
globalFilter: globalFilter-example
...
```

In this case, all requests in HTTPServer `server-example` go through GlobalFilter `globalFilter-example` before executing any other pipelines.

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| beforePipeline | [pipeline.Spec](#pipelineSpec) | Spec for before pipeline | No |
| afterPipeline | [pipeline.Spec](#pipelinespec) | Spec for after pipeline | No |

### EaseMonitorMetrics

EaseMonitorMetrics is adapted to monitor metrics of Easegress and send them to Kafka. The config looks like:

```yaml
kind: EaseMonitorMetrics
name: easemonitor-metrics-example
kafka:
  brokers: ["127.0.0.1:9092"]
  topic: metrics
```

| Name  | Type                                                 | Description          | Required |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| kafka | [easemonitormetrics.Kafka](#easemonitormetricsKafka) | Kafka related config | Yes      |

### FaaSController

A FaaSController is a business controller for handling Easegress and FaaS products integration purposes.  It abstracts `FaasFunction`, `FaaSStore` and, `FaasProvider`. Currently, we only support `Knative` type `FaaSProvider`.

For the full reference document please check - [FaaS Controller](7.04.FaaSController.md)

### IngressController

The IngressController is an implementation of [Kubernetes ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/), it watches Kubernetes Ingress, Service, Endpoints, and Secrets then translates them to Easegress HTTP server and pipelines. The config looks like:

```yaml
kind: IngressController
name: ingress-controller-example
kubeConfig:
masterURL:
namespaces: ["default"]
ingressClass: easegress
httpServer:
  port: 8080
  https: false
  keepAlive: true
  keepAliveTimeout: 60s
  maxConnections: 10240
```

- `nsAddress` and `nsNetwork` are optional name server information for all DNS
  providers, if provided, AutoCertManager will leverage them to speed up the
  DNS record lookup. `nsAddress` is the address of the name server, must always
  include the port number, `nsNetwork` is the network protocol of name server,
  it should be `udp` in most cases.

Below table list other required fields for each supported DNS provider (Note: `google` is temporarily disabled due to dependency conflict):

#### Retry Policy

A retry policy configures how to retry a failed request.

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| maxAttempts | int | The maximum number of attempts (including the initial one). Default is 3 | No |
| waitDuration | string | The base wait duration between attempts. Default is 500ms | No |
| backOffPolicy | string  | The back-off policy for wait duration, could be `EXPONENTIAL` or `RANDOM` and the default is `RANDOM`. If configured as `EXPONENTIAL`, the base wait duration becomes 1.5 times larger after each failed attempt | No |
| randomizationFactor  | float64 | Randomization factor for actual wait duration, a number in interval `[0, 1]`, default is 0. The actual wait duration used is a random number in interval `[(base wait duration) * (1 - randomizationFactor),  (base wait duration) * (1 + randomizationFactor)]` | No |

#### CircuitBreaker Policy

CircuitBreaker leverges a finite state machine to implement the processing logic, the state machine has three states: `CLOSED`, `OPEN`, and `HALF_OPEN`. When the state is `CLOSED`, requests pass through normally, state transits to `OPEN` if request failure rate or slow request rate reach a configured threshold and requests will be shor-circuited in this state. After a configured duration, state transits from `OPEN` to `HALF_OPEN`, in which a limited number of requests are permitted to pass through while other requests are still short-circuited, and state transit to `CLOSED` or `OPEN`
based on the results of the permitted requests.

When `CLOSED`, it uses a sliding window to store and aggregate the result of recent requests, the window can either be `COUNT_BASED` or `TIME_BASED`. The `COUNT_BASED` window aggregates the last N requests and the `TIME_BASED` window aggregates requests in the last N seconds, where N is the window size.

Below is an example configuration with both `COUNT_BASED` and `TIME_BASED` policies.

Policy `circuit-breaker-example-count` short-circuits requests if more than half of recent requests failed.

Policy `circuit-breaker-example-time` short-circuits requests if more than 60% of recent requests failed.

> failed means that backend filter returns non-empty results.

```yaml
kind: CircuitBreaker
name: circuit-breaker-example-count
slidingWindowType: COUNT_BASED
failureRateThreshold: 50
slidingWindowSize: 100

---
kind: CircuitBreaker
name: circuit-breaker-example-time
slidingWindowType: TIME_BASED
failureRateThreshold: 60
slidingWindowSize: 100
```

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| slidingWindowType | string | Type of the sliding window which is used to record the outcome of requests when the CircuitBreaker is `CLOSED`. Sliding window can either be `COUNT_BASED` or `TIME_BASED`. If the sliding window is `COUNT_BASED`, the last `slidingWindowSize` requests are recorded and aggregated. If the sliding window is `TIME_BASED`, the requests of the last `slidingWindowSize` seconds are recorded and aggregated. Default is `COUNT_BASED` | No |
| failureRateThreshold | int8 | Failure rate threshold in percentage. When the failure rate is equal to or greater than the threshold the CircuitBreaker transitions to `OPEN` and starts short-circuiting requests. Default is 50 | No |
| slowCallRateThreshold | int8 | Slow rate threshold in percentage. The CircuitBreaker considers a request as slow when its duration is greater than `slowCallDurationThreshold`. When the percentage of slow requests is equal to or greater than the threshold, the CircuitBreaker transitions to `OPEN` and starts short-circuiting requests. Default is 100 | No |
| slowCallDurationThreshold | string | Duration threshold for slow call | No |
| slidingWindowSize | uint32 | The size of the sliding window which is used to record the outcome of requests when the CircuitBreaker is `CLOSED`. Default is 100 | No |
| permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState | uint32 | The number of permitted requests when the CircuitBreaker is `HALF_OPEN`. Default is 10 | No |
| minimumNumberOfCalls | uint32 | The minimum number of requests which are required (per sliding window period) before the CircuitBreaker can calculate the error rate or slow requests rate. For example, if `minimumNumberOfCalls` is 10, then at least 10 requests must be recorded before the failure rate can be calculated. If only 9 requests have been recorded the CircuitBreaker will not transition to `OPEN` even if all 9 requests have failed. Default is 10 | No |
| maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState | string | The maximum wait duration which controls the longest amount of time a CircuitBreaker could stay in `HALF_OPEN` state before it switches to `OPEN`. Value 0 means CircuitBreaker would wait infinitely in `HALF_OPEN` State until all permitted requests have been completed. Default is 0| No |
| waitDurationInOpenState | string | The time that the CircuitBreaker should wait before transitioning from `OPEN` to `HALF_OPEN`. Default is 60s | No |
