`Easegress` is a Cloud Native traffic orchestration system designed for:

- **High Availability:** Built-in Raft consensus & leader election provides 99.99% availability.
- **Traffic Orchestration:** Simple orchestration of various filters for each traffic pipeline.
- **High Performance:** Lightweight and essential features speed up the performance.
- **Observability:** There are many meaningful statistics periodically in a readable way.
- **Extensibility:** It's easy to develop your own filter or controller with high-level programming language.
- **Integration:** The simple interfaces make it easy to integrate with other systems, such as Kubernetes Ingress, EaseMesh(open source coming soon) sidecar, Workflow, etc.

The architecture of Easegress:

## Getting Started

The basic common usage of Easegress is to quickly set up proxy for the backend servers. We split it into multiple simple steps to illustrate the essential concepts and operations.

### Setting up Easegress

We can download the binary from [release page](https://github.com/megaease/easegress/releases). For example we use linux version:

```bash
$ mkdir easegress
$ wget https://github.com/megaease/easegress/releases/download/v1.0.1/easegress-v1.0.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf easegress-v1.0.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C easegress && cd easegress
```

or use source code:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/megaease/easegress && cd easegress
$ make
```

Then we can add the binary directory to the `PATH` and execute the server:

```bash
$ export PATH=${PATH}:$(pwd)/bin/
$ easegress-server
2021-05-17T16:45:38.185+08:00	INFO	cluster/config.go:84	etcd config: init-cluster:eg-default-name=http://localhost:2380 cluster-state:new force-new-cluster:false

```

The default target of Makefile is to compile two binary into the directory `bin/`. `bin/easegress-server` is the server-side binary, `bin/egctl` is the client-side binary. We could add it to the `$PATH` for simplifying the following commands.

We could run `easegress-server` without specifying any arguments, which launch itself by opening default ports 2379, 2380, 2381. Of course, we can change them in the config file or command arguments that are explained well in `easegress-server --help`.

```bash
$ egctl member list
- options:
    name: eg-default-name
    labels: {}
    cluster-name: eg-cluster-default-name
    cluster-role: writer
    cluster-request-timeout: 10s
    cluster-listen-client-urls:
    - http://127.0.0.1:2379
    cluster-listen-peer-urls:
    - http://127.0.0.1:2380
    cluster-advertise-client-urls:
    - http://127.0.0.1:2379
    cluster-initial-advertise-peer-urls:
    - http://127.0.0.1:2380
    cluster-join-urls: []
    api-addr: localhost:2381
    debug: false
    home-dir: ./
    data-dir: data
    wal-dir: ""
    log-dir: log
    member-dir: member
    cpu-profile-file: ""
    memory-profile-file: ""
  lastHeartbeatTime: "2021-05-05T15:43:27+08:00"
  etcd:
    id: a30c34bf7ec77546
    startTime: "2021-05-05T15:42:37+08:00"
    state: Leader
```

After launched successfully, we could check the status of the one-node cluster. It shows the static options and dynamic status of heartbeat and etcd.

### Create an HTTPServer and Pipeline

Now let's create an HTTPServer listening on port 10080 to handle the HTTP traffic.

```bash
$ echo '
kind: HTTPServer
name: server-demo
port: 10080
keepAlive: true
https: false
rules:
  - paths:
    - pathPrefix: /pipeline
      backend: pipeline-demo' | egctl object create
```

The rules of routers above mean that it will lead the traffic with the prefix `/pipeline` to the pipeline `pipeline-demo`, which will be created below. If we `curl` it before created, it will return 503.

```bash
$ echo '
name: pipeline-demo
kind: HTTPPipeline
flow:
  - filter: proxy
filters:
  - name: proxy
    kind: Proxy
    mainPool:
      servers:
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:9095
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:9096
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:9097
      loadBalance:
        policy: roundRobin' | egctl object create
```

The pipeline means it will do proxy for 3 backend endpoints in load balance policy `roundRobin`.

### Test

Now you can use some HTTP clients such as `curl` to test the feature:

```bash
$ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:10080/pipeline
```

If you are not set up some applications to handle the 9095, 9096, and 9097 in the localhost, it will return 503 too. We prepare a simple service to let us test handily, the example shows:

```bash
$ go run example/backend-service/mirror/mirror.go & # Running in background
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:10080/pipeline -d 'Hello, Easegress'
Your Request
===============
Method: POST
URL   : /pipeline
Header: map[Accept:[*/*] Accept-Encoding:[gzip] Content-Type:[application/x-www-form-urlencoded] User-Agent:[curl/7.64.1]]
Body  : Hello, Easegress
```

### More Filters

Now we want to add more features to the pipeline, then we could add kinds of filters to the pipeline. For example, we want validation and request adaptation for the `pipeline-demo`.


<p align="center">
  <img src="./doc/pipeline-demo.png" width=240>
</p>


```bash
$ cat pipeline-demo.yaml
name: pipeline-demo
kind: HTTPPipeline
flow:
  - filter: validator
    jumpIf: { invalid: END }
  - filter: requestAdaptor
  - filter: proxy
filters:
  - name: validator
    kind: Validator
    headers:
      Content-Type:
        values:
        - application/json
  - name: requestAdaptor
    kind: RequestAdaptor
    header:
      set:
        X-Adapt-Key: goodplan
  - name: proxy
    kind: Proxy
    mainPool:
      servers:
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:9095
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:9096
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:9097
      loadBalance:
        policy: roundRobin

$ egctl object update -f pipeline-demo.yaml
```

After updating the pipeline, the original `curl -v http://127.0.0.1:10080/pipeline ` will get 400 because of the validating. So we changed it to satisfy the limitation:

```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:10080/pipeline -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"message": "Hello, Easegress"}'
Your Request
===============
Method: POST
URL   : /pipeline
Header: map[Accept:[*/*] Accept-Encoding:[gzip] Content-Type:[application/json] User-Agent:[curl/7.64.1] X-Adapt-Key:[goodplan]]
Body  : {"message": "Hello, Easegress"}
```

We can also see Easegress send one more header `X-Adapt-Key: goodplan` to the mirror service.
