## What is Easegress

`Easegress` is a Cloud Native traffic orchestration system designed for:

- **High Availability:** Built-in Raft consensus & leader election provides 99.99% availability.
- **Traffic Orchestration:** Simple orchestration of various filters for each traffic pipeline.
- **High Performance:** Lightweight and essential features speed up the performance.
- **Observability:** There are many meaningful statistics periodically in a readable way.
- **Extensibility:** It's easy to develop your own filter or controller with high-level programming language.
- **Integration:** The simple interfaces make it easy to integrate with other systems, such as Kubernetes Ingress, [EaseMesh](https://github.com/megaease/easemesh) sidecar, Workflow, etc.

The architecture of Easegress:

## Getting Started

The basic usage of Easegress is to quickly set up a proxy for the backend
servers. In this section, we will first set up a reverse proxy, and then
demonstrate the API orchestration feature by including more components in the
configuration, we will also show the essential concepts and operations of
Easegress.

### Setting up Easegress

We can download the latest or history binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/megaease/easegress/releases). The following
shell script will:

- Download and extract the latest binaries to `./easegress` folder
- Install the Easegress Systemd service.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megaease/easegress/main/scripts/install.sh)"
```

or we can install Easegress from source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/megaease/easegress && cd easegress
make
```

> **Note**:
>
> - This repo requires Go 1.19+ compiler for the build.
> - If you need the WebAssembly feature, please run `make wasm`.

Then we can add the binary directory to the `PATH` and execute the server:

```bash
$ export PATH=${PATH}:$(pwd)/bin/
$ easegress-server
2022-07-04T13:47:36.579+08:00   INFO    cluster/config.go:106   etcd config: advertise-client-urls: [{Scheme:http Opaque: User: Host:localhost:2379 Path: RawPath: ForceQuery:false RawQuery: Fragment: RawFragment:}] advertise-peer-urls: [{Scheme:http Opaque: User: Host:localhost:2380 Path: RawPath: ForceQuery:false RawQuery: Fragment: RawFragment:}] init-cluster: eg-default-name=http://localhost:2380 cluster-state: new force-new-cluster: false

```

The default target of Makefile is to compile two binary into the `bin`
directory. `bin/easegress-server` is the server-side binary, `bin/egctl` is the
client-side binary. We could add it to the `$PATH` to simplify the following
commands.

We could run `easegress-server` without specifying any arguments, which launch
itself by opening default ports 2379, 2380, and 2381. We can change them in the
configuration file or command-line arguments that are explained well in
`easegress-server --help`.

```bash
$ egctl member list | grep "ClusterRole"
    ClusterRole: primary
$ egctl member list | grep "APIAddr"
    APIAddr: localhost:2381
$ egctl member list | grep "Name"
    ClusterName: eg-cluster-default-name
    Name: eg-default-name
$ egctl member list | grep "id"
    id: 689e371e88f78b6a
```

After launching successfully, we could check the status of the one-node
cluster. It shows the static options and dynamic status of heartbeat and etcd.

### Create an HTTPServer and Pipeline

Now let's create an HTTPServer listening on port 10080 to handle the HTTP
traffic.

```bash
$ echo '
kind: HTTPServer
name: server-demo
port: 10080
keepAlive: true
https: false
rules:
  - paths:
    - pathPrefix: /pipeline
      backend: pipeline-demo' | egctl object create
```

The rules above mean it will forward the traffic with the prefix `/pipeline` to
the `pipeline-demo` pipeline because the pipeline hasn't been created yet,
we will get 503 if we `curl` it now. Next, let's create the pipeline.

```bash
$ echo '
name: pipeline-demo
kind: Pipeline
flow:
  - filter: proxy
filters:
  - name: proxy
    kind: Proxy
    pools:
    - servers:
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:9095
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:9096
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:9097
      loadBalance:
        policy: roundRobin' | egctl object create
```

The pipeline means it will forward traffic to 3 backend endpoints, using the
`roundRobin` load balance policy.

### Test

Now you can use an HTTP clients, such as `curl`, to test the feature:

```bash
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:10080/pipeline
```

If you haven't set up backend services on ports 9095, 9096, and 9097 of the
localhost, it returns 503 too. We provide a simple service for this:

```bash
$ go run example/backend-service/mirror/mirror.go & # Running in background
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:10080/pipeline -d 'Hello, Easegress'
Your Request
===============
Method: POST
URL   : /pipeline
Header: map[Accept:[*/*] Accept-Encoding:[gzip] Content-Type:[application/x-www-form-urlencoded] User-Agent:[curl/7.64.1]]
Body  : Hello, Easegress
```

### Add Another Pipeline

Now let's add another pipeline, it will get the address of an RSS feed from the
request, read the RSS feed, build the article list into a Slack message, and
then send it to Slack. But before creating the pipeline, please follow [this
document](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to create your own Slack
webhook URL and replace the one in the below command with it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./doc/imgs/rss-pipeline.png" width=480>
</p>

```bash
$ echo '
name: rss-pipeline
kind: Pipeline

flow:
- filter: validator
- filter: buildRssRequest
  namespace: rss
- filter: sendRssRequest
  namespace: rss
- filter: decompressResponse
  namespace: rss
- filter: buildSlackRequest
  namespace: slack
- filter: sendSlackRequest
  namespace: slack
- filter: buildResponse

filters:
- name: validator
  kind: Validator
  headers:
    "X-Rss-Url":
       regexp: ^https?://.+$

- name: buildRssRequest
  kind: RequestBuilder
  template: |
    url: /developers/feed2json/convert?url={{index (index .requests.DEFAULT.Header "X-Rss-Url") 0 | urlquery}}

- name: sendRssRequest
  kind: Proxy
  pools:
  - loadBalance:
      policy: roundRobin
    servers:
    - url: https://www.toptal.com
  compression:
    minLength: 4096

- name: buildSlackRequest
  kind: RequestBuilder
  template: |
    method: POST
    url: /services/T0XXXXXXXXX/B0YYYYYYY/ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ   # This the Slack webhook address, please change it to your own.
    body: |
      {
         "text": "Recent posts - {{.responses.rss.JSONBody.title}}",
         "blocks": [{
            "type": "section",
            "text": {
              "type": "plain_text",
              "text": "Recent posts - {{.responses.rss.JSONBody.title}}"
            }
         }, {
            "type": "section",
            "text": {
              "type": "mrkdwn",
              "text": "{{range $index, $item := .responses.rss.JSONBody.items}}• <{{$item.url}}|{{$item.title}}>\n{{end}}"
         }}]
      }

- name: sendSlackRequest
  kind: Proxy
  pools:
  - loadBalance:
      policy: roundRobin
    servers:
    - url: https://hooks.slack.com
  compression:
    minLength: 4096

- name: decompressResponse
  kind: ResponseAdaptor
  decompress: gzip

- name: buildResponse
  kind: ResponseBuilder
  template: |
    statusCode: 200
    body: RSS feed has been sent to Slack successfully.' | egctl object create
```

### Update the HTTPServer

Now let's update the HTTPServer to forward the traffic with prefix `/rss` to
the new pipeline.

```bash
$ echo '
kind: HTTPServer
name: server-demo
port: 10080
keepAlive: true
https: false
rules:
  - paths:
    - pathPrefix: /rss          # +
      backend: rss-pipeline     # +
    - pathPrefix: /pipeline
      backend: pipeline-demo' | egctl object update
```

### Test the RSS Pipeline

Execute the below command, your slack will receive the article list of the RSS
feed.

```bash
curl -H X-Rss-Url:https://hnrss.org/newest?count=5 http://127.0.0.1:10080/rss
```

Please note the maximum message size Slack allowed is about 3K, so you will
need to limit the number of articles returned by the RSS feed of some
sites(e.g. Hack News).
