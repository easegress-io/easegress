## Pull request guide

When contributing to Easegress, it’s good idea to follow these steps:

1. If there is no issue yet, create an issue of the fix or improvement
2. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   1. `git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/easegress.git`
3. Track the upstream remote
   1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/megaease/easegress.git`
4. Create your branch, for example
   1. `git checkout -b fix/<micro-title>-<issue-number>`
5. Do your changes and commit them
   1. `git commit -am '<descriptive-message>'`
6. Rebase latest changes from upstream remote.
   1. `git checkout main`
   2. `git pull --rebase origin main`
   3. `git pull --rebase upstream main`
   4. `git checkout <your-branch>`
   5. `git rebase main`
7. Push your changes to your branch.
   1. `git push -f origin <your-branch>`
8. You can now open PR. Add a description for your PR.
   
For code changes, remember to add unit tests. Before opening PR, you can use Makefile entries (`make fmt`, `make test`, `make integration_test`) to run unit tests and formatting. CI runs Revive code analysis that you can install and execute locally following [these instructions](https://github.com/mgechev/revive#installation).
