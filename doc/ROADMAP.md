# 2021 Easegress Roadmap
This is what we hope to accomplish in 2021.

## Goal
* To be an extensible cloud-native traffic-specific platform.

### Breakdowns
1. Easegress works as a traffic orchestration system originally. It must be **traffic-specific**. It is implemented to solve usersâ€™ traffic dealing requirements and problems. With Easegress, users can empower their business capabilities,e.g., using Easegress to support Flash-sale activity, protecting their core APIs at peak time, and orchestrating their existing APIs for new business logic.
2. Easegress aims to become an **extensible** platform under the traffic-specific domain. Users can choose to orchestrate ingress/egress traffic via existing filters in a pipeline or customize a brand-new filter/controller for their special traffic-specific business logic. With stable, clean, flat software architecture, users can develop their own filter/controller rapidly and easily. 
3. Easegress is designed to be **cloud-native**. It's scalable, resilient, manageable, and observable. These genes should be kept in it for the rapid future development process. 

## Features
Based on our product goal, we have made a classification of Easegress's features for powering users' business capabilities into two categories, extensibility and traffic-specific.
### Business features for extensibility
* Dynamically load business code written in any language with the lowest performance costing.
* Easy to develop new features with Battery-included Easegress.
* Reusability, such as using Easegress as K8s ingress, Service Gateway, Traffic gateway.
* Easy to operate/easy to install.

### Business features for traffic-specific
* Supporting faster/safer application delivering.
* Providing rich traffic-related metrics.
* Supporting super high concurrent requests scenario,e.g., Flash-sale, Black Friday, Double 11 event.
* Friendly API orchestration.
* Protecting users' core APIs under high traffic pressure.
* Filtering out invalid traffic for backend with IP filter, HMAC validating...
* Mocking backend for testing.
