# 2021 Easegress Roadmap
The list in this roadmap is scheduled to be completed in 2021.


## Product Principles
1. **Traffic Orchestration**. It must be **traffic-specific**. It tries to solve usersâ€™ traffic-based requirements and solutions. Easegress can empower customer business capabilities, e.g., using Easegress to support high concurrent traffic scenarios(such as Flash-Sale, Black Friday, Double 11 event, etc).  And enhancing the APIs orchestration & management.
2. **Opening & Extensibility**.  It aims to be an **extensible-development** platform. Users can organize the existing filters into a pipeline, or totally customize a brand-new filter/controller for their specific business logic. With simple, clean, and flat software architecture, anyone can develop their own filter/controller/pipeline rapidly and easily. 
3. **Cloud Native**. It's designed to be **cloud-native**. It's scalable, resilient, manageable, and observable, and it's easy to be integrated with Cloud Native family - Spring Cloud, Service Discovery, Service Proxy/Gateway, Traffic Obvesevility (metrics, tracing, access log), Kubernetes, Serverless/FaaS, and so on.

## Features
Based on the product goal, Easegress' features for powering users' business capabilities can be classified into two categories,extensibility and traffic-specific.
### Business Extensibility
* Dynamically load business code written in any language with the lowest performance costing.
* Easy to develop new features with Battery-included Easegress.
* Reusability, such as using Easegress as K8s ingress, Service Gateway, Traffic gateway.
* Easy to operate/easy to install.

### Traffic Orchestration 
* Supporting traffic management -  load balance, rate limiting, etc. 
* Supporting super-high concurrent requests scenario,e.g., Flash-sale, Black Friday, Double 11 event.
* Friendly API orchestration - API aggression, API pipeline 
* Protecting core APIs from high traffic load.
* Supporting canary development and traffic coloring.
* Filtering out invalid traffic for the backend.
