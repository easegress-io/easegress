* **Background**: Easegress is commonly used in Traffic Gateway and API Gateway scenarios. This benchmark aims to indicate the performance level of Easegress as Traffic Gateway.

## Preparing
### Environment and Topology
1. **Baremetal**: AWS r5.xlarge X 3 (4core/32GB memory/100GB disk/Up to 10 Gigabit bandwidth) 
2. Operation system 
``` bash

### Configuration
**NGINX**

```bash

user www-data;

    server_name  localhost;


    location /pipeline {
        proxy_pass     http://${echo_svr_ip}:9095;
        keepalive_timeout  60;
    }
}
```

**Easegress**
1. Easegress config
``` yaml
name: member-001
cluster-name: cluster-test
cluster-role: primary
cluster-client-url: http://127.0.0.1:2379
cluster-peer-url: http://127.0.0.1:2380
cluster-join-urls:
api-addr: 127.0.0.1:2381
data-dir: ./data
wal-dir: ""
cpu-profile-file:
memory-profile-file:
log-dir: ./log
member-dir: ./member
debug: false
```

2.HTTPServer+Pipeline

``` yaml
- filters:
  - kind: Proxy
    mainPool:
      loadBalance:
        policy: roundRobin
      servers:
      - url: http://${echo_server_ip}:9095
    name: proxy
  flow:
  - filter: proxy
    jumpIf: {}
  kind: HTTPPipeline
  name: pipeline-demo

- http3: false
  https: false
  keepAlive: true
  keepAliveTimeout: 60s
  kind: HTTPServer
  maxConnections: 10240
  name: server-demo
  port: 10080
  rules:
  - host: ""
    hostRegexp: ""
    paths:
    - backend: pipeline-demo
      headers: []
      pathPrefix: /pipeline
      rewriteTarget: ""
```

3. HTTPPipeline for baseline
* In order to compare with NGINX's index.html API. The Pipeline uses ResponseAdaptor to reply an NGINX' index.html like response.(Yeah, replace `nginx` with `easegress` already)

``` yaml
name: pipeline-demo
kind: HTTPPipeline
flow:
  - filter: rsp
filters:
  - name: rsp
    kind: ResponseAdaptor
    header:
      del:
      set:
      add:
    body: >+
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
      <title>Welcome to easegress!</title>
      <style>
          body {

            margin: 0 auto;
            font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
          }
      </style>
      </head>
      <body>
      <h1>Welcome to easegress!</h1>
      <p>If you see this page, the easegress web server is successfully installed and working. Further configuration is required.</p>

      </body>
      </html>
```

**Traefik**
1. Running binary directly with command `./traefik -c ./traefik.yml` [1]
2. Static config: traefik.yaml
``` yaml 
log:
  level: INFO

entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":8081"

providers:
  file:
    filename: /${file_path}/dynamic_conf.yml

```
3. Dynamic config: dynamic_conf.yml
``` yaml
http:
  routers:
    my-router:
      rule: "PathPrefix(`/pipeline`)"
      service: foo
      entryPoints:
      - web

  services:
    foo:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
        - url: "http://${echo_server_ip}:9095"
```

**Echo Server**
1. [Source code](https://github.com/megaease/easegress/tree/main/example/backend-service/mirror)
2. Its logic is accepting HTTP request and printing to the console, in this testing, we only use `9095` port.

1. NGINX processes use most time in system mode, may due to the context switch between kernel mode and user mode. 
2. Easegress/Traefik uses goroutine user-space scheduling for avoding heavy context switching cost.

## Benchmark Linux vs Windows

The test is based on <https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-plus-sizing-guide-how-we-tested/> comparing Linux, Windows version Esagress.

### Result Summary
 
 * loader -> upstream: AVG RPS 10491.82
 * loader -> linux Easegress: AVG RPS 3187.94 (30.38% of raw)
 * loader -> Windows Easegress: 3484.75 (33.21% of raw), _note: 2 Non-2xx or 3xx responses_
 * loader -> NGINX proxy: AVG RPS 2313.15 (22.04% of raw)

### Hardware and Topology

To minimize the factors, 5 Azure VMs, with SKU [Standard D8s v3 (8 vcpus, 32 GiB memory)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv3-dsv3-series), in same VNet were divided into 5 roles:

 * upstream: a NGINX act as server
 * eg: linux build of Easegress
 * egwin: windows build of Easegress
 * ngx: a NGINX proxy to upstream for baseline
 * loader: wrt to generate load to 


### Software 
 
 Easegress build with Go 1.16.6 @ `d2e5887` <https://github.com/megaease/easegress/pull/74>

 * upstream: Ubuntu 20.04.2, NGINX 1.18.0-0ubuntu1.2

   default config with 1kb file

   `/var/www/html$ dd if=/dev/random of=1kb.bin bs=1KB count=1`

 * eg: Ubuntu 20.04.2
 * egwin: Windws 2019 Server Core [10.0.17763.2061]

   config:
   
   ```
   kind: HTTPServer
   name: server-demo
   port: 10080
   keepAlive: true
   https: false
   rules:
     - paths:
       - pathPrefix: /
         backend: pipeline-demo

   name: pipeline-demo
   kind: HTTPPipeline
   flow:
     - filter: proxy
   filters:
     - name: proxy
       kind: Proxy
       mainPool:
         servers:
         - url: http://172.18.0.4/
         loadBalance:
           policy: roundRobin
   ```

 * ngx: Ubuntu 20.04.2, NGINX 1.18.0-0ubuntu1.2

   default config with `proxy_pass http://upstream/;`

 * loader: Ubuntu 20.04.2, wrt @ `a211dd`, gcc version 9.3.0

### Test script

Same as NGINX blog

```
for i in `seq 1 number-of-CPUs`; do
    taskset -c $i wrk -t 1 -c 50 -d 180s http://Reverse-Proxy-Server-IP-address/1kb.bin &
done
```
