## 4. Reference Guide

### 4.1 Controllers

The Easegress controller is the core entity to control kinds of working. There are two kinds of controllers - system and business. 

For the full document, please check - [Controller Reference](./reference/controllers.md)

#### 4.1.1 System Controllers

The following controllers are system level controllers.  One and only one instance of them are created in every Easegress node and they can't be deleted. 

- [ServiceRegistry](./reference/controllers.md#serviceregistry) - The service hub for all service registries - Consul, Etcd, Eureka, Zookeeper, Nacos...
- [TrafficController](./reference/controllers.md#trafficcontroller) - TrafficController handles the lifecycle of HTTPServer and HTTPPipeline and their relationship. 
- [RawConfigTrafficController](./reference/controllers.md#rawconfigtrafficcontroller) - RawConfigTrafficController maps all traffic static configurations to TrafficController in the namespace `default`.

#### 4.1.2 Business Controllers

It could be created, updated, deleted by admin operation. They control various resources such as mesh traffic, service discovery, faas, and so on.

- [EaseMonitorMetrics](./reference/controllers.md#) - Monitor metrics of Easegress and send them to Kafka.
- [FaaSController](./reference/controllers.md#faascontroller) - For Easegress and FaaS products integration purpose.
- [IngressController](./reference/controllers.md#ingresscontroller) - an implementation of Kubernetes ingress controller, it watches Kubernetes Ingress, Service, Endpoints, and Secrets then translates them to Easegress HTTP server and pipelines. 
- [MeshController](./reference/controllers.md#meshcontroller) - This is for [EaseMesh](https://github.com/megaease/easemesh) project.
- [ConsulServiceRegistry](./reference/controllers.md#consulserviceregistry) - supports service discovery for Consul as backend. 
- [EtcdServiceRegistry](./reference/controllers.md#etcdserviceregistry) - support service discovery for Etcd as backend. 
- [EurekaServiceRegistry](./reference/controllers.md#eurekaserviceregistry) - supports service discovery for Eureka as backend. 
- [ZookeeperServiceRegistry](./reference/controllers.md#zookeeperserviceregistry) -  supports service discovery for Zookeeper as backend. 
- [NacosServiceRegistry](./reference/controllers.md#nacosserviceregistry) - supports service discovery for Nacos as backend.
- [AutoCertManager](./reference/controllers.md#autocertmanager) - automatically manage HTTPS certificates. 

### 4.2 Filters

- [API Aggregator](./reference/filters.md#APIAggregator) - The API Aggregator forwards one request to multiple API HTTP Pipelines in the same namespace and aggregates responses.
- [Proxy](./reference/filters.md#Proxy) - The Proxy filter is a proxy of backend service. 
- [Bridge](./reference/filters.md#Bridge) - The Bridge filter route requests from one pipeline to other pipelines or HTTP proxies under an HTTP server.
- [CORSAdaptor](./reference/filters.md#CORSAdaptor) - The CORSAdaptor handles the CORS preflight request for backend service.
- [Fallback](./reference/filters.md#Fallback) - The Fallback filter mocks a response as fallback action of other filters. 
- [Mock](./reference/filters.md#Mock) - The Mock filter mocks responses according to configured rules, mainly for testing purposes.
- [RemoteFilter](./reference/filters.md#RemoteFilter) - The RemoteFilter is a filter making remote service acting as an internal filter. 
- [RequestAdaptor](./reference/filters.md#RequestAdaptor) - The RequestAdaptor modifies the original request according to configuration.
- [CircuitBreaker](./reference/filters.md#CircuitBreaker) - The CircuitBreaker is a finite state machine with three states: `CLOSED`, `OPEN`, and `HALF_OPEN`.
- [RateLimiter](./reference/filters.md#RateLimiter) - The RateLimiter protects backend service for high availability and reliability by limiting the number of requests sent to the service in a configured duration.
- [TimeLimiter](./reference/filters.md#TimeLimiter) - The TimeLimiter limits the time of requests, a request is canceled if it cannot get a response in configured duration.
- [Retryer](./reference/filters.md#Retryer) - The Retryer retries failed requests according to configured policy.
- [ResponseAdaptor](./reference/filters.md#ResponseAdaptor) - The ResponseAdaptor modifies the original response according to the configuration before passing it back.
- [Validator](./reference/filters.md#Validator) - The Validator filter validates requests, forwards valid ones, and rejects invalid ones. 
- [WasmHost](./reference/filters.md#WasmHost) - The WasmHost filter implements a host environment for user-developed WebAssembly code.
